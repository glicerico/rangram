The current repo is an attempt to test the ULL pipeline, and some of its components,
on a number of grammars.

First we use very simple hand-coded grammars as a sanity test to make sure the grammar
learner does what is required in a basic POC, perhaps similar to POC-Turtle and POC-English,
but starting from a given grammar instead of arbitrary sentences. 
An advantage of generating
a grammar this way is that we can get an arbitrary number of sentences from it, so building
large corpora from it is easier than making them by hand.
The first tested gramar is in simple_grammar0.txt and consists of 6 grammatical classes
(2 related to nouns, 1 to verbs, 1 to adjectives, 1 to adverbs and 1 to determiners).
Each class has only one possible word and disjuncts are created having in mind the
English language rules; no Zipfian correlations are expected in the resulting corpus.

Later, we experiment with randomly created grammars, which follow a number of parameters,
specified in the header of file of such a grammar:
% RANDOM GRAMMAR with parameters:
% num_words = 20
% num_classes = 4
% num_class_connectors = 7
% connectors_limit = 2
