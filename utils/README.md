Scripts for the evaluation of methods that process the grammars generated by rangram.

Three processing methods are evaluated at the moment:
- Stream parser (in `process_SP.sh`)
- ULL parser (in `process_ULLP.sh`)
- Grammar Learner from Gold Standard parses (in `process_GL.sh`)

`process_all.sh` runs the three scripts mentioned above to evaluate all methods. Processing takes place in subfolders that correspond to each method, and all results are summarized in `all_results.txt`
