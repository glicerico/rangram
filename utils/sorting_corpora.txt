The corpus generator has a bias towards producing less likely sentences towards the end of the corpus.
To avoid that when selecting subcorpora, we can order the corpus and its gold standard alphabetically.

To sort corpora and their gold standards alphabetically, we can use vim.

- Open corpus/GS in vim
- subtitute newlines with '~' by: '%s/\(.\)\n/\1\~/g
- sort by 'sort'
- restore newlines by: '%s/\~/\r/g'
